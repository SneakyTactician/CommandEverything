# CommandEverything
A command line to do everything and anything.

##Features:

###Custom Scripts
We now support file based scripts. Simply create a file, save it.
Then run the execute script command, use the file dialog to pick the file, and hit okay.
Watch as your script runs!
Any command that is valid in the console is valid in the file.

###Logging
Your entire command line history for each instance of the command line is saved to a text file under the "Logs" folder, in the same directory as your executable.
